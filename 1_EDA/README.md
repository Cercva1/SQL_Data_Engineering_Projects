# Exploratory Data Analysis w/ SQL: Job Market Analysis

![Project 1 Overview](../Images/1_1_Project1_EDA.png)

A SQL project analyzing the data engineer
job market using real world job posting data.
It demonstrates my ability to **write production-quality
analytical SQL, design efficient queries,
and turn business questions into data-driven insights**.

## Executive SUmmary

- **Project scope:** Built **3 analytical queries** that answer key questions about the data engineer job market
  **Data modeling:** Used **multi-table joins** across fact and dimension tables to extract insights
  **Analytics:** Applied **aggregations, filtering, and sorting** to find top skills by demand, salary, and overall value
  **Outcomes:** Delivered **actionable
  insights** on SQL/Python dominance, cloud trends, and salary patterns

if you only have a minute, review these:

1. [01_top_demanded_skills.sql](1_EDA/01_top_demanded_skills.sql) - demand analysis with multi-table joins
2. [02_top_paying_skills.sql](1_EDA/02_top_paying_skills.sql) - salary analysis with aggregations
3. [03_optimal_skills.sql](1_EDA/03_optimal_skills.sql) - combined demand/salary optimization query

## Problem & Context

Job market analysts need to answer questions like:
**Most in-demand:** _Which skills are most in-demand for data engineers?_

- **Highest paid:** _Which skills command the highest salaries?_
  **Best trade-off:** _What is the optimal skill set balancing demand and compensation?_

This project analyzes a **data warehouse** built using a star schema design.
The warehouse structure consists of:
! [Data Warehouse](../Images/1_2_Data_Warehouse.png)

- **Fact Table:** 'job_postings_fact - Central table containing job posting details (job titles, locations, salaries, dates, etc.)
  **Dimension Tables:**
  'company_dim' - Company information linked to job postings
- 'skills_dim' - Skills catalog with skill names and types
- **Bridge Table:** iskills_job_dim' - Resolves the many-to-many relationship between
  job postings and skills
  By querying across these interconnected tables, I extracted insights about skill demand,
  salary patterns,
  and optimal skill combinations for data engineering roles.

## Tech Stack

• **Query Engine:** DuckDB for fast OLAP-style
analytical queries
**Language:** SQL (ANSI-style with analytical functions)
**Data Model:** Star schema with fact +
dimension + bridge tables
**Development:** VS Code for SQL editing +
Terminal for DuckDB CLI
**Version Control:** Git/GitHub for versioned
SQL scripts

## Analysis Overview

### Query Structure

1. **[Top Demanded Skills](01_top_demanded_skills.sql)** - Identifies the 10 most in-demand skills for remote data engineer positions
2. **[Top Paying Skills](02_top_paying_skills.sql)** - Analyzes the 25
   highest-paying skills with salary and demand metrics
3. **[Optimal Skills](./03_optimal_skills.sql)** - Calculates an optimal score using natural
   log of demand combined with median salary to identify the most valuable skills to learn

### Key Insights

Core languages: SQL and Python each appear in
~29,000 job postings, making them the most demanded skills
Cloud platforms: AWS and Azure are critical
for modern data engineering roles-
Infra & tooling: Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform are associated with premium salaries

- • Big data tools: Apache Spark shows strong demand with competitive compensation

## SQL Skills Demonstrated

### Query Design & Optimization

- **Complex Joins**: Multi-table 'INNER JOIN' operations across 'job_postings_fact',
  'skills_job_dim', and skills_dim'
- **Aggregations**: COUNT()', MEDIAN()',
  \*ROUND ()
  ' for statistical analysis
- **Filtering**: Boolean logic with 'WHERE' clauses and multiple conditions
  ('job_title_short', 'job_work_from_home,
  'salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL)
- **Sorting & Limiting**: 'ORDER BY' with 'DESC' andiLIMIT for top-N analysis

### Data Analysis Techniques

- **Grouping**: 'GROUP BY' for categorical analysis by skill
- **Conditional Logic**: 'CASE WHEN'
  statements
  for derived metrics
- **Mathematical Functions**: 'LN()' for natural logarithm transformation to normalize demand metrics
- **Calculated Metrics**: Derived optimal score combining log-transformed demand with median salary
  **HAVING Clause**: Filtering aggregated results
  (skills with > 100 postings)
- **NULL Handling**: Proper filtering of incomplete records ['salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL'!|
